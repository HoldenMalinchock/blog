The speed and ease of use of tools as a developer is critical to a developers productivity.  Developer experience has become more and more of a buzzword as of late with different products being developed explicitly for this purpose.  I am quite fond of, Deno, but new products are being released daily with a focus on taking management out of the day to day.

I think an often overlooked aspect, particularly in corporate settings, is all the things outside the software you use and write.  Things like the hardware you are working on.  The restrictions set on corporate VPN's for speed throttling.  The type of computer you are on.  All these things play an important role in the productivity of your developers to spend more time solving real problems.  I have found myself fighting against my own environment with things out of my control more than I code sometimes.

I am fortunate enough to have a M2 Macbook for my personal use which is about as fast as it gets.  I am spoiled and wouldn't expect most companies to provide something that pricey.  But even when more quality computers are provided they are often so bogged down with corporate software and other junk they will always be noticably slower than your personal computer.

The less friction you create in your developers environment the more efficient they are.  The goal should be maximixing the flow state for your development teams to keep them engaged for longer.  I find it becomes impossible to maintain consistent focus when I am waiting minutes for npm modules to install.  I have experienced blocks on my node modules folder due to corporate software preventing me from deleting the folder for a fresh install.  When I am working on solving a problem and I am in my flow state it kills my focus when I have to blow up my environment and do a fresh git clone just becuase my node modules folder is flagged for not having the permissions.  Getting sidetracked by issues that shouldn't be issues kills your flow the same way being approached for meetings or conversations will.  

Companies need to invest more effort into creating less friction in the environment for developers and not just remove friction across teams.
